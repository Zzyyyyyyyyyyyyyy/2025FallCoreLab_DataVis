# Overview

In this assignment you’ll use chart.js to visualize a dataset of your choosing. 

# Creative Considerations

- What would you like your viewer to take away from looking at this dataset?
- Is there anything that surprised you when you looking at the data?

# Requirements

- Dataset
    - Choose a dataset that interests you (sports, music, weather, movies, social issues, personal tracking data, etc.).
    - Dataset must have at least 20 rows of data.
    - You may find or create your own dataset (CSV, JSON, or hard-coded array).
    
- Chart.js Visualization
    - Use Chart.js to display your dataset in at least one chart.
    - Charts can be bar, line, pie, scatter, radar, or mixed types.
    - You must include labels, titles, and legends so the chart is understandable.
- Interactivity
    - Add at least one interactive feature to your chart or page, such as:
        - Dropdown or buttons to filter or change the chart view.
        - Hover effects/tooltips that explain the data.
        - Toggle between different chart types.
- Styling
    - Apply CSS to make the page visually engaging and readable
